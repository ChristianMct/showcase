      description:  Anonymous communication in browsers via the Tor network
      layman_desc: >
          A Javascript library for browsers for anonymous communication via the
          Tor network. The library connects to the Tor network to enable
          websites to send and retrieve data anonymously (e.g. send sensitive
          information without identifying the user) without requiring users to
          install special software such as the Tor browser.

    - name:         Trickster
      description:  Sophisticated attacks on Machine Learning models
      layman_desc: >
          Trickster allows to attack machine learning models where the attack
          needs to be more sophisticated than simply adding some noise to an
          image. One example is to evade an abuse detection model, for example,
          social media bot detection, or a malware detector.

      layman_desc: >
          This library provides implementations of two cryptographic data
          structures: fast traversal blockchain structure, and a verifiable
          dictionary, implemented as a key-value Merkle tree.
