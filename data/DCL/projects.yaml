      description:  Automatically chosing best locking algorithm
      tech_desc: >
        GLS is a middleware that makes lock-based programming simple and
        effective. GLS offers the classic lock-unlock interface of locks.
        However, in contrast to classic lock libraries, GLS does not require
        any effort from the programmer for allocating and initializing locks,
        nor for selecting the appropriate locking strategy.

    - name:         AggregaThor
      description:  Framework over TensorFlow implementing robust Stochastic Gradient Descent
      tech_desc: >
          Framework built over TensorFlow implementing state-of-the-art
          Byzantine-resilient, distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
          Modular approach allows most of its components to be reused in other
          projects. Unreliable communication channels are supported, providing
          a performance speed-up over standard TensorFlow in saturated
          networks.

      description:  Better fault-tolerance and performance of consensus using RDMA
      tech_desc: >
          Leveraging Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to improve the
          fault-tolerance and performance of consensus, compared to existing
          protocols. In some cases, RDMA allows us to circumvent existing
          theoretical lower bounds (solving Byzantine consensus with 2f+1
          replicas, for instance).

      description:  Asset Transfer System using lightweight broadcast-based primitives instead of consensus
      tech_desc: >
          We replace consensus with a lightweight building block -- a
          broadcast-based primitive -- to obtain a full-fledged asset transfer
          system (cryptocurrency). This system is more efficient and more
          scalable compared with Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions. AT2 is
          the first system to bypass consensus algorithms for implementing
          asset transfers.
