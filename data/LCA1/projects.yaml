      layman_desc: >
          Drynx is a library for simulating a privacy-preserving and verifiable 
          data sharing/querying tool. It offers a series of independent 
          protocols that when combined offer a verifiably-secure and safe 
          way to compute statistics and train basic machine learning models 
          on distributed sensitive data (e.g., medical data).
