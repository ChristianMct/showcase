      description:  Privacy-preserving cohort exploration
      layman_desc: >
          MedCo enables privacy-preserving cohort exploration by providing ways
          of querying medical datasets with end-to-end encryption of queries,
          data at rest, in transfer and during computation, all the while
          guaranteeing differential privacy.

    - name:         Drynx
      description:  Decentralized, Secure, Verifiable System for Statistical Queries and Machine Learning on Distributed Datasets
      tech_desc: >
          Drynx is a library for simulating a privacy-preserving and verifiable 
          data sharing/querying tool. It offers a series of independent 
          protocols that when combined offer a verifiably-secure and safe 
          way to compute statistics and train basic machine learning models 
          on distributed sensitive data (e.g., medical data).
