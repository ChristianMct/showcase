      description:  Machine Learning framework to search a database via similarity samples
      layman_desc: >
          Use machine learning to organize a collection of objects (e.g. faces
          of actors) so as to make them interactively searchable via similarity
          queries.
          The approach combines concepts from representation learning,
          reinforcement learing, discrete-choice theory and bayesian inference.
