      description:  IP Parallel Redundancy Protocol
      layman_desc: >
          IPRP allows parallel transmission of data over a network for hard
          real time applications with simply installing an app on both the
          server and the client.

      layman_desc: >
          This project defines a message format, based on Cap'n Proto, for
          encoding certain mathematical objects (i.e., real-valued symbolic
          expressions, sets and set-valued functions) as sequences of bytes.

        T-RECS is a software testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids. T-RECS uses
        software containers to run each agent in a virtual environment. Agents are networked via Mininet,
        so real packets are exchanged using TCP/IP.
