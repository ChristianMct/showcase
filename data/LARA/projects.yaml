      description:  Verification framework for a subset of the Scala programming language
      layman_desc: >
          Stainless is a tool for verifying Scala programs developed by the
          LARA. It can verify that your program is correct for all inputs, it
          can report inputs for which your program fails when they exist, and
          it can prove that functions do not loop. As an example application,
          Stainless can perform verification of Smart Contracts.

      description:  Constraint solver for Stainless
      layman_desc: >
          Inox can be used to prove constraints on methods in a program, to
          attest the correctness of these parts.
